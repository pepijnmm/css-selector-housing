# css-selector-housing
chrome extention build arround css-selector-generator
# setup and update
if you haven't yet. install node.js
use `npm install css-selector-generator` it will generate the js file the extention needs.
after that run the `node '.\setup and update.js'` it will add the files you need to the root and remove the rest.
You can also do this manually by moving the index.js that you find in node_moduels/css-selector-generator/build and renaming it to css-selector-generator.js
